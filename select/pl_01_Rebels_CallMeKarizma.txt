Raise some hell before we ghost
Break the rules, a broken nose
You know us, we're soldiers
Rips and holes and baggy clothes
Drippy hard from head to toes
We won't budge for no one
Rebels
Walking
Don't know where we goin' but we
mobbin', yeah
You looking for the jewels but
we got it
Yuh, get out our way or join in
the riot
Hear the sirens?
(Quiet, shh)
Everything is burning and I love
it
Sit and watch the world until
it's nothing
Scared of going out into the
public
Yeah, we the kings now
Take it if you can't afford to
cop it
Talk about a baller on a budget
Clue me till they put me in a
coffin
Yeah, let it sing out
Raise some hell before we ghost
Break the rules, a broken nose
You know us, we're soldiers
Rips and holes and baggy clothes
Drippy hard from head to toes
We won't budge for no one
Rebels
Riding, yeah
Start to the top, there's no
getting by it
Nah, that's just like fireworks
in the sky and
Yuh, don't be afraid of heights
'cause we flying
Hear the sirens?
(Quiet, shh)
Everything is burning and I love
it
Sit and watch the world until
it's nothing
Scared of going out into the
public
Yeah, we the kings now
Take it if you can't afford to
cop it
Talk about a baller on a budget
Clue me till they put me in a
coffin
Yeah, let it sing out
Raise some hell before we ghost
Break the rules, a broken nose
You know us, we're soldiers
