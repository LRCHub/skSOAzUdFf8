Honey don't walk out, I'm too drunk to follow
You know you won't feel this way tomorrow
Well, maybe I'm a little rough around the edges
Inside a little hollow
I get faced with some things sometimes
That are so hard to swallow

Hey (Hey, hey, hey!)
I was born a rebel
Down in Dixie (hey, hey, hey) on a Sunday morning
Yeah with one foot in the grave
And one foot on the pedal
I was born a rebel
Was born a rebel

Well she picked me up in the morning
And she paid all my tickets
Yeah she screamed in the car
And left me out in the thicket
Well I never would've dreamed
That her heart was so wicked
Oh but I keep coming back
Cause it's so hard to kick it

Hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey!)
I was born a rebel
Down in Dixie (hey, hey, hey) on a Sunday morning
Yeah with one foot in the grave
And one foot on the pedal
I was born a rebel
Born a rebel

Even before my father's fathers
They called us all rebels
Burned our cornfields
And left our cities leveled
I can still feel the eyes
Of those blue-bellied devils
When I'm walking around tonight
Through the concrete and metal

Hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey!)
I was born a rebel
Down in Dixie (hey, hey, hey) on a Sunday morning
Yeah with one foot in the grave
And one foot on the pedal
I was born a rebel
I was born a rebel

Hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey!)
I was born a rebel
Down in Dixie (hey, hey, hey) on a Sunday morning
Yeah with one foot in the grave
And one foot on the pedal
I was born a rebel
Born a rebel

Hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey!)
Hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey!)
Hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey!)
Hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey!)
Hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey!)
