He walks slowly with a bounce that's in time,
He likes to find all the things you try to hide,
He's got a couple dishes in a couple places,
He's got a scar, so you can't hardly mistake him,
But, how much further can you get climbing the same old stairs?

And at the top of the deck are the others,
They like to shake his hand and tell them that "they brothers"...
They say "come in, you can pick up the place,
We'll pay you nice so you won't have to take",
But, how much further can you get climbing the same old stairs?

It seems like when we get something special,
They buy it up and sell it back to the rebels.
And i don't like it any more then the next man, i just do what i can.

His best friend's a talking cat named "coco",
She liked it better being a nomad named "russ",
Back of the church 1873, south africa to holland she's seen.
Don't ask her what she thinks about the modern day,
All the dreams seemed to have faded away.
She don't like it when they call their friend their "brother",
She don't need to trip to tell apart the colors.

It seems like when we get something special,
They buy it up and sell it back to the rebels.
And i don't like it any more then the next man,
You know what i'm saying, i just do what i can.

It seems like when we get something special,

Back to the cat; he's the blackest cat i've ever seen,
That won't help you in a run-in with a pig,
Why don't you tell me coco, which way to go,
Where the river flows and i can be alone?

I don't like this place, there's too much damn pressure,
To live a life i don't quite condone,
I feel like i ain't getting nowhere
That's what i get for climbing the same old stairs.

It seems like when we get something special,
They buy it up and sell it back to the rebels.
I don't like it any more then the next,
Man, you know what i'm saying, i just do what i can.
It seems like when we get something special,
They buy it up and sell it back to the rebels.
I don't like it any more then the next,
Man, you know what i'm saying, i just do what i can.

Nowadays, you know, we all want something better
Tangled up between the wires and the papers,
I don't like it any more then the next man,
You know what i'm saying, i just do what i can.
