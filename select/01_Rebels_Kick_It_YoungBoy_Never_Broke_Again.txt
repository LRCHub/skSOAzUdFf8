Wheezy outta here
Ain't no goin' back, my nigga Wheezy on the track
Yeah
Yeah
Can I take a minute for to tell you how I'm living? Yeah
I'd rather show you, fuck the critics, I'ma try leave out the killing
Young nigga pull up in that Bentley with no head
This a motion picture from the trenches, check how a nigga kick it
For a lil' big benji, pop out, get wheelied, yeah
Whole lot of big benjis, fuck 'round, I spend it, yeah
Strapped down, I'm with it, fuck 'round and I hit it, yeah
Sending God my wishes, still got some pending, yeah
I'm with some hoes more realer than these niggas, and that's a fact
I'm with my bros more triller than these bitches, understand that
Youngin from the slums and he don't wanna tote no pistol, we ain't heard of that
I'ma let him play it, we coming from a pencil, he don't know 'bout a trap, nah
Get trapped in fucking with these hoes, she just want a baby
More deep into life, he worried 'bout his goals, she think it's crazy
All through the night, back to back hearin' them poles, this shit amazing
In his hood, he don't see no greatness, he gon' grow or let it faze him
Nigga fade him
Got some OG's in the hood gon' ride 'bout him
They like that he keep his head in them books so they won't let you slime 'bout him
Police probably slide on him
Only for to see if he got that fire on him
But youngin ain't gettin' that, he ain't feelin' that
So he learned to hide on 'em
Now let me tell you that I'm a different breed
Had my first baby at 16, no Plan B, I had one dream
And it was something like Luther King, wanted for to keep the peace but couldn't
Turned 17, 'fore you knew it, me and Ben was hopping from out of bushes
At them bitch ass niggas
Shit, you gon' die or you gon' take one? Nigga, what's your answer?
You up that fire, you better break one, nigga, what's the hassle?
Still to this day, I'm on FaceTime talkin' with the pastor
Like is they with me or against me, probably want me splattered
Can I take a minute for to tell you how I'm living? Yeah
I'd rather show you, fuck the critics, I'ma try leave out the killing
Young nigga pull up in that Bentley with no head
This a motion picture from the trenches, check how a nigga kick it
What you thinkin' 'bout, what you hearin' 'bout? I'ma see about it, nigga (I'm with you)
You got twenty on that nigga head, then make it forty, nigga
Shit, you know me still on dummy, I'll put a hundred, nigga
For to see you smile, I risk my life, that's on my mama, nigga
You was with me at rock bottom, nigga, I ain't forget it
When I wanted to slide, they ain't wan' drive me, nigga, and you was with it
When I was hollerin', "Who want problems?" You was holdin' up your semi
I kept on sayin' I'ma burn this bitch down, you was tellin' me, "Let's get it"
My day one, you my brother
And I love you to death
I'll never go against you
I ain't never put anything before you
Not these diamonds, not this money
Or neither these hoes, whatever goes
Can I take a minute for to tell you how I'm living? Yeah
I'd rather show you, fuck the critics, I'ma try leave out the killing
Young nigga pull up in that Bentley with no head
This a motion picture from the trenches, check how a nigga kick it
For a lil' big benji, pop out, get wheelied, yeah
Whole lot of big benjis, fuck 'round, I spend it, yeah
Strapped down, I'm with it, fuck 'round and I hit it, yeah
Sending God my wishes, still got some pending, yeah
Yeah, Wheezy laid the beat
I'm a slimeball for real
I spin it, yeah
